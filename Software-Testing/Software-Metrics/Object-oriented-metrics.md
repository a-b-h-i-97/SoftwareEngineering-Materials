##Object oriented metrics:

* Depends on:
	- Number of use cases.
	- Number of key classes (Highly independent components). These are defines early in object oriented analysis and are central to the problem domain. This can also give an idea about the potential number of reuse to be applied during the development.
	- Number of support classes. These are required to implement the system but are not immediately related to the problem. Estimation of number of support classes can be made from the key classes.
	- Average number of support classes per key class.
	- Number of subsytem: A subsystem is an aggregation of classes that support a function that is visible to the end  user.
