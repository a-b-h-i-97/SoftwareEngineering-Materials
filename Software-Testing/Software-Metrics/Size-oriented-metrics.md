##Size oriented metrics

* Derived by normalizing quality or/and productivity measures considering the size of the software produced.
* (say) 1000 lines of code (KLOC) are often choosen as a normalization value
	- Errors per KLOC (Errors are found by deelopers)
	- Defects per KLOC (Defects are found by user)
	- Dollars per KLOC
	- Dollars per page of documentation
	- KLOC per person-month
	- Erorrs per person-month
* This method is not a popular process metric.
* Opponents argue that:
	- KLOC depends on programming language.
	- Cannot easily accomodate nonprocedural languages.
