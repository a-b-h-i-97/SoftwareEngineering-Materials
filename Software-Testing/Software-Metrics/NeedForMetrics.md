##Goal of software metrics

* To improve product quality and development team productivity.
* Measures software development output as a function of effort and time.
* Define measures of usability.

##Process metrics
* Software process is a set of activities required to develop a software system. (Like waterfall model)
* They are used to make useful strategic decisions.
* We measure the effectiveness of a process by deriving a set of matrices based on the outcomes of the process:
	- Errors uncovered before the release of the software.
	- Defects delivered to and reported  by the users.
	- Work product delivered.
	- Human effort expended.
	- Calender time expanded.
	- Conformance to the schedule.
	- Time and effort to complete each generic activity

##Project metrics
* Enables the project manager to:
	- Assess the status of the ongoing project.
	- Track potential risks.
	- Untrack problem areas before they becomes critical.
	- Adjust work flow or tasks.
	- Evaluate the project team's ability to control quality of software work products.
* Metrics from the past projects can be used to find the estimated time and effort.
* As time progress, the amount of time and effort spended are compared with the estimated values. (Helps to verify, if the project is moving as expected)
* As technical works start the following two also contibute to project metric:
	- Production rates.
	- Error uncovered during each generic framework activity.
* As a summary:
	- Quality improves.
	- Defects go down.
	- Rework go down.(Hence, cost reduced).


##Metrics for software quality:
* Correctness
* Maintainability: Program can be corrected if an error is found. Maintainable programs on a average have a lower MTTC


##Definitions:
* MTTC: Mean time to change. the time to analyze, design, implement, test and distribute a change to all users. 
* DRE: Defect removal efficiency. DRE = E/(E+D) 
	- E: the number of errors found before delivery
	- D: the number of defects found after delivery
	- As D increases DRE decreases. Ideal value of DRE = 1, which means no defects are found.
	- DRE encourages to find as many errors before delivery.
